# General Overview
This project is dedicated to creating a weather prediction application utilizing Python for both front-end and back-end, using Python's Discord.py library for the user UI, and initially integrating both WeatherAPI for live weather statistics and Railway for remotely running the application and database information management.

# Project Requirements
- User can make a request for live weather data giving the application the necessary location information (country, region, etc.)
- User can make a request for weather prediction of a certain date in the future based on historical data patterns for a specific defined location by the user (country, region, etc.)
- User can make a request for weather prediction for a series of days in a row within the future based on historical data patterns for a specific defined location by the user (country, region, etc.)
- User can pull from database all past information requested to the application.
- User can request all data from the database be transfered into a downloaded Excel document.
- User can request statistical probabilities for types of weather to occurr duirng a date or series of dates set for a specific location.
